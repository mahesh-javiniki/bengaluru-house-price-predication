# 🖼️ Client

This folder contains the frontend of the House Price Prediction application.

## 📄 Files

- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file that structures the web page.
- **`styles.css`**: The CSS file for styling the user interface.
- **`app.js`**: The JavaScript file that handles user interactions, sends requests to the backend server, and displays the predicted price.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The client is a simple, static web page that allows users to input house details and get a price prediction. It communicates with the backend via an API call to the `/predict_house_price` endpoint.
